This project defines a project software design solution.
Business Requirements:
  a. Clearly define the problem the system aims to solve.
  b. Specify the functionalities the system needs to provide.
  c. Identify the target users and their needs.
  d. Outline any business goals the system should support.
2. Non-Functional Requirements:
  a. Define performance requirements like scalability, response time, and throughput.
  b. Specify security requirements like authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
  c. Outline maintainability requirements like code modularity, documentation, and testing strategies.
  d. Indicate any other non-functional requirements relevant to the system's success.
System Design using Domain Modeling (100 points)
1. UML Use Case Diagram (10 points):
  a. Create a visual representation of the system's actors (users and external systems) and their interactions with the system.
2. UML Domain Model (10 points):
  a. Identify key entities and their relationships within the problem domain, independent of any specific technology.
3. UML Class Diagram (10 points):
  a. Translate the domain model into a set of classes, their attributes, and relationships, reflecting the system's functionality.
4. UML Sequence Diagrams (10 points):
  a. Show the message flow between objects participating in specific use cases, depicting the interaction sequence.
5. UML State Diagram (10 points):
  a. Illustrate the possible states and transitions an object can undergo throughout its lifecycle within the system.
6. UML Activity Diagram (Swimlane Diagram) (10 points):
  a. Visually represent the activities and flows within a specific process, highlighting the responsibility of different actors using swim lanes.
7. UML Component Diagram (10 points):
  a. Depict the system's physical components and their dependencies, providing a high-level architectural view.
8. Cloud Deployment Diagram (10 points):
  a. Illustrate the chosen cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure) and how the system's components will be deployed within it.
9. Skeleton Classes and Tables Definition (10 points):
  a. Provide basic outlines of the main classes involved, including their attributes and methods.
  b. Define the structure of any database tables required to store system data.
10. Design Patterns (10 points):
  a. Explain any GRASP, SOLID, GOF, Microservices design patterns and best practices implemented in your design, justifying their use for specific scenarios.
